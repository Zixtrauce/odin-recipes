TOP Recipes project
Live site: https://zixtrauce.github.io/odin-recipes/

This is the Recipes project which I have completed as I work through The Odin Project, in order to familiarize myself with HTML.

The website will have a couple of pages with some recipes curated by a close friend, a collection she calls "Cooking for Dummies. This site will only contain a small excerpt of such recipes. 

Hopefully this will be the beginning of a large portfolio of projects.
